# HYDAC_Capacity_Forecasting_Models

This repository will document and store my internship project for creating a capacity planning sheet.

The two primary directories are the Clustering Model and the Regression Model. 
The clustering model identifies assembly numbers that can be generalized to the remainder of the part heirarchy. 
The regression model predicts the sales of each part family over time given trained trends in historical data. 

Additionally, several methods were conducted for data visualization available for view where applicable. 

Please check out my work!
